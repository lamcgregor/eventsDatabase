# eventsDB

__Small events calendar. Google Maps API locations and MySQL database events storage.!__

## Planned additions

These are additions to the base code I plan to make at some point along the way.

### In the works already

- Use geolocation to set events default location.

### Plan to Implement

- Copying events - for when one event is likely to be repeated or similar.

- Events lasting longer than a day.

- Prettier calendar, that works with the longer events.

- Register page to add new users.

- Work on htaccess file tidy ups for URLs.
